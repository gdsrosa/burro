### Your First Component

**Only** consider starting the development of a new component if the [Design Process](#design-process) is OK.

The first thing to do, is to create an issue on [Development Project](https://github.com/opensanca/burro). Link every pull request to this issue. The project board will guide the steps of development:

- **Todos**: backlog of tasks.
- **In progress**: tasks that are under development.
- **Deploy**: tasks that are on branch master (in production).
- **Add to styleguide**: after deploy, make a [pull request on styleguide](https://github.com/ContaAzul/styleguide) with your feature.
- **Done**: last step. On this column we have control of what has been released.

With the issue created, you can start to development your component.

1. *(Optional)* Create a directory with a CSS file on [components CSS folder](https://github.com/).
2. Import this stylesheet on [donkey.css file](https://github.com/).
3. Create a HTML inteface test on [interface/standalone directory](https://github.com/).
4. *(Optional)* Create a directory with a JavaScript file on [components JavaScript folder]().

A good example of a component is the [Breadcrumb](http://donkey.opensanca.github.io/#!donkey):

- [breadcrumb.css]()
- [breadcrumb.js]()
- [breadcrumbTest.js]()

### Solving a bug

You can contribute to the project by solving a bug! Check the issues with [bug label on Github](https://github.com/). If there is no issue related to your bug, create an issue on [Development Project](https://github.com/).

With the issue created, send a [pull request](#pull-request) to donkey-ui.
